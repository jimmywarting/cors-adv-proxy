cors-adv-proxy
==============

A CORS proxy replacement. Based partly on http://crossorigin.me.

## What?
Unlike other cors proxies this allows you to
 1. Use any http method you request
 2. Control exactly what headers are being sent n' received
 3. And last but not least: Override http method

## How?
 Good question
